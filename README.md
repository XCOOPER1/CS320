# Portfolio Projects

Overview

This repository contains key projects that demonstrate my abilities in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. From Project One, I've included the contact service files: `Contact.java`, `ContactService.java`, `ContactTest.java`, and `ContactServiceTest.java`. From Project Two, I have submitted my summary and reflections report. These projects showcase my skills in creating unit tests to uncover errors and analyzing various approaches to software testing based on requirements.

Reflection

 How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality and security, I focus on writing comprehensive unit tests to verify that each part of my program behaves as expected. I use techniques such as boundary testing, negative testing, and stress testing to identify potential issues before they become critical. Security is addressed by following best practices for input validation, securing sensitive data, and regularly reviewing code for vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs is crucial for building effective software. I begin by gathering requirements through direct communication or documentation, ensuring I comprehend the problem the software is solving. These needs are translated into concrete features and testable requirements that drive my development process, ensuring that the program fulfills the userâ€™s expectations.

How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I take a systematic approach. I begin by breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable components. Next, I design the system architecture and create modular, reusable code. Throughout the process, I apply design principles such as SOLID and DRY to ensure maintainability and scalability. The use of diagrams, pseudocode, and flowcharts also helps me visualize the program structure before I start coding.
